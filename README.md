## Preliminary Questions

1. **How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?**
    
    * From the starting of the project my main intention was, to make the app structure modular and type-safe so that I can have the least amount of bugs while coding and in production.
   
    * Due to this, I used typescript along with react and created a modular structure for redux with type safety.
  
    * The major part of the app was the initial type-safe modular code setup and to be honest, it took me 3 days to setup the boilerplate but after that i was able to finish the functionality i intended to create much faster.
  
    *  I realized that utilizing the time to build up the base is much better than getting stuck in the long run.


2. **Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?**

   * Well i am not sure about this. 

3. **What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?**

    * I worked on the app in a way that I didn't want any workarounds but due to time limitation, I had to do some workarounds. I wouldn't do that if I did get more time, i would've researched over it very well and would find a better solutions.
